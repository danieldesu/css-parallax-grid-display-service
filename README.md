Text content: It's basically a (bad?) joke. Finland has a great welfare system, but I also see people banter and call these people rats. Rats are cute, as seen in the pictures. The Kela Rotta (meaning rat) program is the sillification of the welfare system. I don't know. I think one of my friends will find it funny.

Basically, it's a html, css heavy website with parallax + grid that displays a fake service. With rats. It's also in my webpack/babel template despite having extremely minimal JavaScript code (basically just a setInterval)

npm run install for dependencies
Build with npm run build.
Webpack server with npm run dev, running on port 3000.
